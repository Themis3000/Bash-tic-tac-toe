# Bash-tic-tac-toe
A simple bash program that allows you to play a friend in the art of tic tac

This program attemps to make tic tac toe in the fewest lines possible

file clean.sh is a easyer to understand version complete with comments attempting to explain

file short.sh is the shortest I could possibly make it (while using normal formatting) with no explination (soon to be released, still working on)
